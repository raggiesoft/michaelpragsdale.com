// Icon Spacing for Prefixes and Suffixes
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This provides automatic spacing for Font Awesome icons when placed inside
// elements like .button or .card-link.

// Target any element that might contain an icon
.button,
.card-link,
.nav-link { // We can add more parent selectors here as needed

  // --- Prefix Icon ---
  // Select an icon (.fa-fw) that is the FIRST child, but NOT the ONLY child.
  // This means it's an icon with text after it.
  > .fa-fw:first-child:not(:last-child) {
    margin-right: var(--spacing-sm);
  }

  // --- Suffix Icon ---
  // Select an icon (.fa-fw) that is the LAST child, but NOT the ONLY child.
  // This means it's an icon with text before it.
  > .fa-fw:last-child:not(:first-child) {
    margin-left: var(--spacing-sm);
  }

  // We target .fa-fw specifically because you mentioned using it,
  // and it's good practice for alignment. We use the direct child selector (>)
  // to avoid accidentally styling nested icons.
