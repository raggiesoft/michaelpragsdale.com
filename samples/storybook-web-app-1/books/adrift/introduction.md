# Adrift: An Interactive Saga

Welcome, reader, to the harrowing journey of the Miller, Anderson, and Walker families. What began as ordinary lives aboard the sprawling Aethelburg Station is about to be violently upended by the sudden outbreak of a galactic war.

Torn from their homes and separated from their parents, six young cousins find themselves thrust into a desperate struggle for survival. They must navigate the terrifying void of space in a woefully inadequate lifeboat, protect their most vulnerable members, and confront challenges that will test the very limits of their endurance, their ingenuity, and their familial bonds. Aiden and Elara, twins with profound special needs including autism and cerebral palsy, require constant, intensive care â€“ a monumental task even in a peaceful, well-equipped environment, now made nearly impossible amidst the chaos of war and dwindling resources.

Follow Izzy, Sophia, Olivia, and Chloe as they rise to unimaginable responsibilities, fighting to keep their family intact and alive. Their hope: a distant outpost named Bastion. Their path: fraught with peril.
