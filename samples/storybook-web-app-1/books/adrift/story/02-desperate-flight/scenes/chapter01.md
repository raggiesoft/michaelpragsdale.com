The launch wasn't a gentle ascent; it was a *violent ejection*. One moment, Aiden was amidst the chaos of the bay, the next, an invisible giant crushed him into the metal floor. The roar of the engines vibrated through his very bones, a physical assault. He couldn't move his legs, couldn't brace, couldn't understand anything except the sudden, brutal pressure and the terrifying *falling upwards* sensation.

Then the alarms started – high-pitched, stabbing sounds that pierced through his ears and seemed to scramble his thoughts. Red lights pulsed, turning the cramped space into a nightmarish a-go-go, the familiar faces of his cousins – his *only* anchors – distorted with a fear he’d never seen before. Sophia’s sharp commands, Olivia’s choked reassurances, Elara’s first whimpers – it was all too much, too loud, too *wrong*.


He felt bodies pressing against him, unfamiliar and terrifying in their closeness. The G-forces shifted, throwing him sideways, then pinning him again. Outside, flashes of green and red ripped through the blackness – sudden, blinding, and utterly incomprehensible. His world, already stripped of his parents and his chair, was now stripped of its *rules*. Gravity was wrong. Sound was wrong. Sight was wrong. Everything was *pain*.


A low moan started deep in his chest. He tried to rock, his only self-soothing motion, but the G-forces and the bodies pinned him. Trapped. He was trapped. The moan climbed higher, turning into a desperate hum. His eyes darted wildly, finding no comfort, only flashing lights and contorted faces. He couldn't process. He couldn't think. He could only *feel* the terror, a rising tide threatening to swallow him whole.

Izzy’s face appeared above him, her lips moving, her eyes wide. He knew her, but the noise drowned her out, the flashing lights fractured her face. She wasn't *safe Izzy*; she was part of the *chaos*. He bucked, an instinctive, primal need to *escape* the unbearable input.

"Aiden! No!"

Her cry was just another sharp noise. The tide crested. The world broke. Aiden screamed, a long, piercing sound devoid of meaning, full only of raw, undiluted terror. His world dissolved. He thrashed, fighting an unseen enemy, fighting the G-forces, fighting the hands that tried to hold him, fighting the sounds and the lights. He was a cornered animal, blind and terrified.

The ship lurched, a sickening twist, and his head slammed into cold, hard metal. Pain, sharp and bright, exploded through the red haze of his fear. And in that moment of impact, the last vestiges of his control shattered. He felt the humiliating warmth spread, the pressure release – his body betraying him even as his mind drowned. Pee and poop, blood and screams, all blurred into one overwhelming, inescapable torrent of absolute terror.

Elara, beside them, crumpled. The G-forces, the noise, her brother's raw terror – it all crashed down. She curled into a tight ball, her hands flying to her ears, a high-pitched, rhythmic keen escaping her lips. Her body rocked back and forth. Izzy instinctively looked towards Elara. Normally, *this* was when Elara, Aiden's twin sister, despite her own fear, would be there. She’d have a bio-bag ready. But Elara wasn't there. She was gone, lost in her own sensory hell.

"They found us!" Chloe screamed. The lifeboat *snapped*, throwing them violently. Aiden’s thrashing became frantic *fighting*. He swung his arms wildly, his fists connecting blindly but forcefully with Izzy’s ribs, then Sophia’s arm. He had no control, no recognition.

"Hold him! Pin his arms!" Sophia yelled. She and Olivia threw their weight across him. Izzy, sobbing, tried to keep his head from smashing against the floor again.

"WHOA!" Chloe screamed. A massive laser blast seared past their canopy. "**THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE!**" The near-death experience only intensified the meltdowns.

"I can't keep this up!" Chloe cried, her eyes frantically scanning the nav-console. "There has to be somewhere... I need somewhere to set down! *Now!*"
