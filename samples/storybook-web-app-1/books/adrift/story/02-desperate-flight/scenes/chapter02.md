"There!" Chloe choked out, pointing a trembling finger at a small, swirling dot on the long-range scanner – a moon, grey-green, where no moon should be. It wasn't on any chart. It was a ghost. It was *hope*. "It's a long shot... they might follow... but it's *something*! Hold on!"

Ignoring the fuel warnings, ignoring the groaning protests of the lifeboat, she slammed the thrusters to full. The tiny ship leaped forward, a desperate, final sprint. One last volley of enemy fire chased them, but Chloe, riding the high wire between instinct and training, jinked and rolled, pushing the boat far beyond its limits. They broke sensor lock just as the first tendrils of the moon's upper atmosphere began to whisper across their hull.

The entry was rough. The lifeboat shuddered and bucked, heat shields flaring erratically. The sounds changed from the 'whoosh' of space to the roar and buffet of air. Inside, the chaos barely subsided. Aiden’s screams continued, a relentless soundtrack.

Chloe leveled out, flying low and fast over a cratered, rocky landscape under an alien sky. Her eyes, red-rimmed and raw, scanned every shadow, every cliff-face. "Oxygen is thin, but breathable," she reported, her voice hoarse. "No tech signals... Come on... come on... where... *There!*"

It was a dark gash in a low mountain range – a large cave opening, deep enough, maybe, to hide their small ship. With the last of her strength and focus, Chloe guided the battered lifeboat towards it. The landing was anything but gentle. They skipped once, twice, on the rocky terrain, the landing gear groaning in protest, before skidding to a jarring halt deep within the shadows of the cavern mouth.

The engines whined down. The alarms died with a final, pathetic beep.

And then... silence.

A profound, echoing silence, broken only by Elara’s ragged sobs and Aiden’s relentless, agonized cries. He was still lost, thrashing weakly now, his strength failing but his terror unabated. He lay amidst the filth, blood crusted in his hair, his only clothes ruined.

They were down. They were hidden. They were alive. Olivia looked at Izzy and Sophia. "We can't... we can't stop it," Sophia whispered, shaking her head. "We just have to... wait. Keep them safe."

Their first moments of 'safety' wouldn't be spent tending wounds or cleaning up, or even catching their breath. They would be spent here, in this cramped, foul-smelling metal box, acting as human padding, whispering words that weren't heard, enduring the heartbreaking sounds of their youngest cousins' agony, and waiting. Waiting for the storm to break.
