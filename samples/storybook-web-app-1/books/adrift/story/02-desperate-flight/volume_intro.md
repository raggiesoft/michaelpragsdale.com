## Book II: Desperate Flight

The escape from Aethelburg was only the beginning. In this second volume of the Adrift Saga, the six cousins face the immediate, terrifying reality of their situation. Crammed into a tiny, defenseless escape pod, they are pursued by a relentless enemy. 

Chloe's untested piloting skills are their only shield against destruction. Inside the pod, the physical and emotional toll mounts: Aiden and Elara suffer severe autistic meltdowns, Aiden sustains an injury, and the lack of supplies, space, and privacy pushes everyone to their limits. Izzy is forced to perform critical care for Aiden under impossible conditions for the first time. Their desperate search for any safe haven leads them to an uncharted moon, offering a sliver of hope amidst overwhelming despair.
