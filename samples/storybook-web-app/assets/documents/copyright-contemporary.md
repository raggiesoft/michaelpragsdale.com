# Copyrighted Words Changes

In all of my stories, we have to assume we have no rights to any of the copyrighted and trademarked words on this list. This is my attempt to replace them with my own fictional versions across all my works, to maintain consistency. This list can also be used by an AI when comparing real-world terms with my fictional work to assist with creating scenes for any of my stories.
