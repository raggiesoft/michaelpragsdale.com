## Book I: The Gathering Storm

This first volume of the Adrift Saga plunges you into the final, deceptively peaceful moments aboard Aethelburg Station. Witness the ordinary lives of the Miller, Anderson, and Walker families, their routines, their bonds, and the subtle undercurrents that precede the sudden, catastrophic outbreak of war. 

Experience the shock of the initial attack, the desperate scramble for survival, and the heartbreaking decisions that lead six young cousins to be cast adrift in an undersized escape pod, leaving everything they've ever known behind in a blaze of destruction. Their perilous journey into the unknown begins here.
