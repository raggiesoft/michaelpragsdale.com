The simulated sunrise of Aethelburg Station crept across Sector Gamma-7, and with it, the familiar rhythms of the Miller-Anderson-Walker households. In the Miller apartment, David’s gentle, "Morning, A-man," was the first sound Aiden heard, followed by the quiet efficiency of his parents. Sarah already had his specialized nutrient mix ready, supplies laid out. The transfer to his high-tech wheelchair, the journey to their spacious, accessible restroom – it was a dance they knew well. David handled the delicate, necessary digital stimulation for Aiden’s morning toileting, his touch practiced and reassuring, while Sarah managed the showering and dressing. Izzy, Aiden's cousin, might poke her head in with a cheerful greeting, but this intimate care was the sole, loving domain of his parents. Elara, Aiden’s twin, navigated her own morning with her familiar limp, her own CP and autistic needs managed within the supportive family structure.

Breakfast was a communal affair, the three families merging, before the six cousins headed off to their shared passion: the Greenhouses.

Here, amidst the vibrant flora of Earth and alien worlds, they found their peace. Aiden, in his chair, explored with Izzy often by his side, while Elara, leaning on his chair for support, chatted. Olivia, the eldest, consulted with station botanists; Sophia, ever practical, managed schedules; Chloe, quiet and observant, often sketched. It was a life of routine, of shared purpose, of profound, unspoken love, all under the protective hum of Aethelburg. It was a day like any other – predictable, safe, full of routine and the quiet love of a close-knit family, utterly oblivious to the fact that soon, everything they know will be torn apart.
