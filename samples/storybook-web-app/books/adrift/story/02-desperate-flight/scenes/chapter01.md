The escape pod’s launch was not a gentle ascent but a violent ejection. In one heartbeat, Aiden was ripped from the chaos of the bay and slammed against the cold metal floor. The roar of the engines shook him to his core—a relentless, physical assault that vibrated through his very bones. Overwhelmed by crushing G-forces, he could neither move his legs nor brace himself; the familiar world he’d known disintegrated into brutal pressure and the surreal sensation of “falling upwards.”

As the pod careened through space, alarms erupted—a high-pitched, piercing shriek that sliced through his muddled thoughts. Inside the cramped cabin, red emergency lights pulsed in time with his racing heart, transforming every surface into a nightmarish blur. The distorted faces of his twin sister, Elara, and his cousins—Izzie, Olivia, Chloe, and Sophia—melted into one chaotic mass of terror. Every command, every desperate shout melded into a cacophony that left Aiden drowning in sensation.

Trapped in that unyielding vise, Aiden felt the crushing weight of bodies pressed against him—each touch unfamiliar and disorienting. The forces shifted abruptly, hurling him sideways before pinning him even harder. Outside, flashes of green and red exploded against the darkness, momentarily obliterating his ability to think. Gravity itself seemed to have unraveled; sound assaulted him, and every pulse of light seared his skin. All he could do was endure the ceaseless, unrelenting pain.

Deep within his disoriented state, a low, desperate moan began to build—a sound that spoke of his inner terror far louder than any scream. As he struggled to rock back and forth in a futile attempt at self-soothing, his body betrayed him further. For Aiden, who depended on rigorously scheduled, specialized care for his toileting needs due to his paralysis from the waist down, the loss of control was more than physical agony—it was a wrenching disruption of a routine he relied on for dignity. In the chaos of the pod, without any caregiver to help him, urine and feces surged uncontrollably, mingling in a humiliating torrent that added to his overwhelming distress.

Then, amidst the sensory overload and a rising tide of terror, a crushing impact shattered his already fragile equilibrium. His head slammed against the unforgiving metal wall—a sickening crack echoing in his ears as a jagged cut split his scalp. Blood intermingled with sweat and the other fluids on his face, the pain so sharp it rivaled the relentless pounding of his heart. His mind, overwhelmed by chaos, registered this as yet another brutal assault in a cascade of endless torment.

Aiden’s vision blurred further as he caught a fleeting glimpse of Izzie’s terrified face above him—her eyes wide, her lips moving in frantic urgency—but the roar of the alarms and the relentless pounding of G-forces rendered her features into a fractured, ghostly smear. Even the comforting familiarity of his family transformed into another element of the shifting nightmare. Instinctively, he bucked against the invisible confines, a primal surge to escape the relentless pressure. His fists, uncontrolled and desperate, collided blindly—striking against anyone too near, whether it was Izzy, Sophia, or even Olivia.

In a devastating punctuation to the unfolding horror, a massive laser blast tore past the pod’s canopy. A resounding “WHOA!” erupted from those around him, a momentary exclamation that only deepened the nightmare.

Amid the tumult, Chloe’s eyes flitted over the nav-console with frantic determination. “There has to be somewhere… I need somewhere to set down! Now!” she shouted, her voice a blend of terror and fierce resolve. In that instant, the escape pod transformed from a meager lifeboat into a crucible of relentless assault—a place where every sense was overrun and every hope was pounded into submission by the unyielding forces of chaos.

For Aiden, each second became a torrent of raw, unfiltered sensations—the bone-shaking violence of the ejection, the blinding strobe of emergency lights, the searing pain from his head wound, and the degrading loss of bodily control that stripped even his most essential self-care routines of their dignity. His body and mind were locked in a desperate struggle, every fragment of him consumed by the relentless terror of a world that had unceremoniously abandoned all semblance of order and care.
