# Aiden Miller

**Full Name:** Aiden Miller  
**Nickname:** "A-man" (primarily used by close family)  
**Age:** 18 (at the start of *Adrift Saga*)  
**Family:** Miller  
**Twin:** Fraternal twin to Elara Miller (younger by 12 minutes)

## Primary Caregivers
- **Initial:**  
  - David Miller (father)  
  - Sarah Miller (mother)
- **Post-Evacuation:**  
  - Isabelle "Izzy" Walker (cousin)  
  - With assistance from Sophia Anderson and Olivia Walker (cousins)

## Physical Description & Presentation
- Aiden is an 18-year-old young man who is paralyzed from the waist down due to severe cerebral palsy.
- He relies on comprehensive physical care for all aspects of mobility and personal needs, including toileting and hygiene.
- On Aethelburg Station, he utilized a high-tech power wheelchair for mobility, which was necessarily abandoned during the hasty evacuation because of the escape pod's limited space.
- Following a head injury sustained during the escape pod launch (where he slammed his head against a bulkhead), he has a cut on his head with blood matting in his hair, making bandaging difficult.
- Due to the emergency, he is in soiled clothing with no immediate spares available.

## Communication & Cognitive Profile
- Aiden is profoundly affected by severe autism and is non-verbal.
- **Modes of Communication:**
  - Facial expressions
  - Sounds (moans, grunts, hums, screams)
  - Physical gestures (e.g., flailing or bucking when in extreme distress)
- His primary caregivers—especially his parents and his cousin Izzy—have learned to interpret many of his needs and emotional states.
- On Aethelburg Station, he also used an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) device, which was presumably lost during the evacuation.
- He thrives on routine and predictability.
- Sudden, intense sensory input (loud alarms, flashing lights, extreme G-forces, chaotic environments) can quickly overwhelm him, leading to severe autistic meltdowns.

## Personality & Emotional State (Pre-Evacuation)
- In the structured, supportive environment of Aethelburg Station, Aiden experienced moments of peace, especially in the Greenhouses.
- He was deeply cherished by his parents, which provided him with a sense of security and stability.

## Situation & Key Challenges (Post-Evacuation)
- **Extreme Trauma:**  
  - The violent ejection from Aethelburg, the chaotic escape pod journey, and the loss of his parents, routine, and mobility aids have plunged him into near-constant terror and sensory overload.
  - These factors trigger severe and prolonged autistic meltdowns.
- **Total Dependence:**  
  - His paralysis and non-verbal autism mean he is entirely reliant on his young cousins for all physical needs, including toileting and medical attention for his head wound.
- **Sensory Overload in the Escape Pod:**  
  - The cramped, noisy, and erratically moving escape pod is an overwhelming and hostile environment.
- **Communication Breakdown:**  
  - The loss of his AAC device severely hampers his ability to communicate his needs.
- **Physical Injury & Lack of Supplies:**  
  - Aiden sustains a bleeding head wound and remains in soiled clothing with no immediate spares available, compounding his physical and emotional distress.

## Narrative Role & Significance
- Aiden, along with his twin sister Elara, represents the most vulnerable members of the family in the narrative.
- His profound needs and his extreme reactions to trauma heighten the stakes for his cousins, establishing a central emotional and logistical challenge.
- His care and the impact of his condition underscore themes of family bonds, resilience, and the human cost of survival in a crisis.
