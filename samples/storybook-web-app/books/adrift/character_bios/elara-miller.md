# Elara Miller

**Full Name:** Elara Miller  
**Nickname:** "Lari"  
**Age:** 18 (at the start of *Adrift Saga*)  
**Family:** Miller (Fraternal twin to Aiden Miller, older by 12 minutes)

## Primary Caregivers
- **Initial:**  
  - David Miller (father)  
  - Sarah Miller (mother)
- **Post-Evacuation:**  
  - Older cousins: Olivia Walker, Sophia Anderson, Chloe Anderson, Isabelle "Izzy" Walker

## Physical Description & Presentation
- Elara is an 18-year-old young woman with cerebral palsy that primarily affects her left leg, causing a noticeable limp.
- On Aethelburg Station, she often leaned on Aiden's wheelchair or her cousins for support.
- During the escape pod ordeal, she is subjected to the same harsh conditions as the others.

## Communication & Cognitive Profile
- Elara has autism and is verbal, but she struggles with communicationâ€”especially under extreme stress.
- She is deeply empathetic, particularly towards her twin brother, Aiden, and often served as an intuitive helper in his care before the escape.
- The intense trauma of the escape pod journey (with its overwhelming G-forces, alarms, and Aiden's severe meltdown) triggers her own autistic meltdown, during which she curls into a ball, covers her ears, and emits a high-pitched keen.

## Personality & Emotional State (Pre-Evacuation)
- On Aethelburg Station, Elara thrived within the supportive family structure, balancing her own needs while staying close to Aiden.
- She shared her family's passion for the Greenhouses.
- Elara is generally observant and, when able, offers thoughtful input.

## Situation & Key Challenges (Post-Evacuation)
- **Shared Trauma:**  
  - She experienced the violent escape and the terrifying journey in the escape pod.
- **Autistic Meltdown:**  
  - The sensory overload and emotional distress trigger a significant meltdown, rendering her temporarily unable to assist either herself or Aiden.
- **Communication Difficulties:**  
  - Her existing struggles with communication are exacerbated by extreme stress.
- **Loss of Routine & Support:**  
  - Like Aiden, she has lost her parents, familiar surroundings, and daily routines.
- **Dependence on Cousins:**  
  - She now relies on her older cousins for safety, decision-making, and emotional support.

## Narrative Role & Significance
- Elara serves as an emotional barometer for the group's shared trauma.
- Her profound bond with Aiden is central to the narrative, and her initial inability to help him during the escape underscores the severity of the situation.
- Her journey will likely involve learning to better cope with her sensitivities while contributing to the group's survival and reconnecting with her supportive role for Aiden as conditions stabilize.
