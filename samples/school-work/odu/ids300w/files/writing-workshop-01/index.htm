						<h3><i class="fa-duotone fa-info-circle me-2" aria-hidden="true"></i>Application of disciplines</h3>
						<p>In fact, the web page you are viewing that comprises this assignment is based on knowing the different pieces. Knowing how to write code is great, but someone also needs to know how to create graphics. An example would be the background you are currently looking at, where our student is on the computer brainstorming ideas for his assignment, and his older sister is at his side to bounce ideas off of.</p>
						<p>For coding: as part of my work at what was then ODU&rsquo;s Center for Learning and Teaching, I was the one primarily responsible for making sure that Canvas &mdash; and <abbr title="Personal Learning Environment" aria-label="Personal Learning Environment" class="fw-bold">PLE</abbr> before it &mdash; met the accessibility requirements of students of all abilities. It is the skill of combining both disciplines that allows me to be a better person to craft websites that meet the needs of anyone who wishes to view them.</p>
						<p>The discipline of writing is necessary because the page needs to be readable without spelling and grammar errors. A website is nothing if there are errors that stick out like sore thumbs.</p>

					</blockquote>
					<h3 class="pt-3"><i class="fa-duotone fa-question-circle me-2" aria-hidden="true"></i>Why do we combine the three disciplines?</h3>
					<p>The justification for combining disciplines is that each has their own strengths that can add to the project. As an example, I&rsquo;m not very good at creating graphics (the background images were crafted using The Sims 4), and I would want to turn to others to help projects along. This webpage uses tools built by others to ensure it can look its best, and these other people have a range of different disciplines. This ensures that the best minds work on the parts that they can do best. For example, I can write the code, while the grahpics wizards at Electronic Arts create the style of artwork that I will use to create characters in The Sims 4.</p>
					<p>If it was not for combining disciplines, this website might not look its best. Having a team work together allows for faster output, and a more cohesive package. If each discipline was not communicating with each other, output would take longer or possibly not happen at all.</p>

					</blockquote>
					<h3 class="pt-3"><i class="fa-duotone fa-info-circle me-2" aria-hidden="true"></i>Combining Different Disciplines</h3>
					<p>Now that there is a problem to solve, it is time to see what disciplines can be used. <strong><i class="fa-duotone fa-computer me-1" aria-hidden="true"></i>Computer Science</strong> is absolutely a great place to start. Websites need to be coded after all. This in of itself combines a range of skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc that all fall under the guise of coding.</p>
					<p>Next up, we need to add in a little bit of <strong><i class="fa-duotone fa-palette me-1" aria-hidden="true"></i>artistry</strong>. Coding is great when it comes to powering a website, but it also needs to look great. Knowing your way around <span class="text-uppercase">Gimp</span>, Paint.NET, or other tools is essential. No one is going to want to visit your website if it does not look its best.</p>
					<p>This little tour of disciplines will wrap up with <strong><i class="fa-duotone fa-paragraph me-1" aria-hidden="true"></i>language arts</strong>. You have the code. You have the graphics. Do you have properly formed words and paragraphs? Typically, writing involves tools like <em><i class="fa-duotone fa-file-word me-1" aria-hidden="true"></i>Microsoft Word</em>, but HTML is nothing more than plain text. Typically, especially for larger company websites (and even the Canvas editor we are using to submit our assignments), copying from Word can be difficult to the point where you might as well type plain text into the editor and not have access to F7.</p>

					</blockquote>
					<h3 class="pt-3"><i class="fa-duotone fa-file-magnifying-glass me-2" aria-hidden="true"></i>What Research is Needed?</h3>
					<p>Creating websites is not too terribly difficult. Learning the code that powers websites - even something as simple as this assignment - is available even at the public school level. However, getting deeper into the topic and allowing for details that seem like a lot (see what I did on Discussion #2 to pretty it up).</p>
					<p>What kind of research can we do? Stack Overflow is your best friend, as it answers most of the technical questions someone might have with creating websites. Another great resource is <em></emn><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin me-1" aria-hidden="true"></i>LinkedIn Learinng</em> which is paid for by Old Dominion University. In this field, there is not much in the way of Google Scholar or Monarch OneSearch (or the Card Catalog for us old timers).</p>
					<p>There are numerous websites that are just a search away that will provide the help you need to get going with your creations. The websites that help with writing that is used for this class is a good example, as you will usually not have access to spell checking and grammar checking when using a code editor. There are also websites that provide you with help in using your favorite graphics tool (and not just <em>Adobe Photoshop</em> but free tools as well such as <em class="text-uppercase">Gimp</em> among other tools.</p>

					<p>Practice makes perfect. Learn how to write the code, learn how to create and/or manipulate images in the editor of your choice, and learn how to write without the aid of spell and grammar checking. Visual Studio Code, the editor I used to create this file, can have a spelling checker as an extension. However, these tools are not as powerful as the checker included with Microsoft Word.</p>

					<p>Combining code with graphics seems easy, but there are several ways to do it. The background images are loaded via CSS and foreground images are loaded by the image tag. For writing: do you want to write in Word and have to fix Word&rsquo;s attempt to pretty up the text but have an advanced spelling and grammar checker, or do you want to use an HTML editor and deal with the spelling and grammar yourself?</p>
