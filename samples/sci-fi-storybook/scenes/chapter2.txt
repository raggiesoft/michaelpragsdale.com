It was Olivia, with her keen botanist's eye, who first saw it, tucked away in Greenhouse Delta. "That's... not right," she murmured, beckoning Sophia and Izzy over. It pulsed with an unnatural, soft blue light, a plant utterly alien and unlisted. As Elara and Aiden approached, the light flared, a low hum vibrating through the air. Aiden became instantly agitated, his hands flailing towards his AAC, low moans of distress escaping him. Cold understanding struck Olivia. "It's artificial. It's broadcasting." Her finger jabbed the emergency comms. "Command, this is Walker, Olivia, Greenhouse Delta. Unidentified, potentially hostile bio-form... appears to be a signaling device."

That report, that impossible plant, was the enemy's first mistake. It gave Aethelburg Station precious, vital time. While Command's science teams scrambled, confirming the plant was indeed a sophisticated tracking and infiltration beacon, the station went on high alert. Defense systems powered up. Evacuation protocols were initiated, not as a panicked scramble, but as an ordered, if frantic, withdrawal. It wouldn't stop the war, but it would save lives.

But even an ordered evacuation is chaos when the first shots are fired. The Klaxons shrieked through the Greenhouses just as Command confirmed the worst: an enemy fleet was decloaking on the system's edge. The rush was terrifying. David, Sarah, Michael, Emily, James, Jessica – all vanished towards their battle stations, their last shouted words, "Lifeboat Bay 7! Stick together! We'll find you!" echoing in their children's ears.

Sophia took the lead, a fierce shepherdess, while Olivia became the calm eye of their personal storm. They found the emergency sled; Aiden’s beloved, now-useless wheelchair, was abandoned without a second thought. They plunged into the sea of fleeing personnel. They reached Bay 7 – a scene of controlled chaos, but chaos nonetheless. And there it was: their lifeboat, a Class-7, barely big enough for a long weekend trip, marked 'Capacity: 3'.

"No," Sophia whispered, but there was no choice. Explosions rocked the bay. They shoved Aiden in first, a dead weight, Izzy and Elara tumbling after. Olivia, Sophia, and Chloe squeezed in last, a desperate, tangled mass of limbs and terror. The hatch sealed.

The pilot's seat was empty. "Someone has to fly it!" Sophia cried. Before anyone could react, Chloe, small and agile, was in it. Her hands, surprisingly steady, flew across the console. She’d spent countless hours in Aethelburg’s advanced flight simulators, dreaming of this, but never like this. "I ran sims," she gasped, her voice tight with a fear that was rapidly being overridden by a strange, focused calm. "I can do this!" With a bone-jarring lurch that slammed them together, the lifeboat launched, Chloe’s dream becoming their only hope as they shot into the terrifying heart of a burgeoning war.
