"There!" Chloe choked out, pointing at a small, swirling dot on the scanner – a moon, uncharted. It was hope. Ignoring fuel warnings, she slammed the thrusters. They sprinted, one last volley chasing them before they broke sensor lock, plunging into the moon’s thin atmosphere.

The entry was rough, the lifeboat shuddering and bucking. Aiden’s screams continued, a relentless soundtrack. Chloe leveled out, flying low over a cratered, rocky landscape. "Oxygen thin, but breathable," she reported. "No tech signals... There!"

It was a dark gash in a mountain range – a large cave opening. With the last of her focus, she guided them in. A skip, a skid, a jarring halt.

The engines whined down. Silence.

A profound, echoing silence, broken only by Elara’s ragged sobs and Aiden’s relentless, agonized cries. He was still lost, thrashing weakly, his strength failing but his terror unabated. He lay amidst the filth, blood crusted in his hair, his only clothes ruined.

They were down. They were hidden. They were alive. Olivia looked at Izzy and Sophia. "We can't... we can't stop it," Sophia whispered, shaking her head. "We just have to... wait. Keep them safe."

Their first moments of 'safety' were spent in that cramped, foul box, acting as human padding, whispering words that weren't heard, enduring the heartbreaking sounds of their youngest cousins' agony, and waiting. Waiting for the storm to break.
