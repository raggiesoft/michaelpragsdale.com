The universe outside the viewport was a maelstrom. Inside, it was anything but silent. The high-pitched scream of the evasive maneuver alarm battled with the low groan of stressed metal. "Hard port! Brace!" Chloe yelled. The G-force slammed them into a near-solid mass.

Aiden’s scream tore through the cabin – raw, primal, absolute sensory overload. His body went rigid, then began to thrash violently. "Aiden! Izzy’s here!" Izzy cried, trying to reach him. "Soph, help me!" Sophia lunged, grabbing Aiden’s shoulder.

Elara, beside them, crumpled. She curled into a tight ball, her hands flying to her ears, a high-pitched, rhythmic keen escaping her lips. She was lost in her own sensory hell.

Then came the crack. Aiden’s head hit the locker. Blood welled. "He's bleeding!" Izzy screamed. Simultaneously, his body lost control. The sharp, acrid wave of urine filled the air, followed by the heavier smell of feces. His only clothes were soiled.

"Oh gods," Izzy's voice broke. She realized Elara, Aiden's twin, her usual partner, couldn't help. She was alone in this. Izzy, tears blurring her vision, fumbled for the med-pouch. With shaking hands, she pulled on one of their few pairs of gloves. While Sophia and Olivia tried to hold Aiden, Izzy began the digital stimulation for the first time in her life. It was a fumbling, terrifying ordeal.

"WHOA!" Chloe screamed. A laser blast seared past. "THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE!" Aiden's thrashing intensified; Elara shrieked louder. Aiden swung his arms wildly, connecting blindly with Izzy and Sophia. It wasn't fighting them; it was fighting the world. They tried to pin his arms.

"I can't keep this up!" Chloe cried, hunting for an escape. "There has to be somewhere... I need somewhere to set down! Now!"
